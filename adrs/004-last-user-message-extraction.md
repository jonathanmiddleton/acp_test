# ADR-004: Extract Only the Last User Message for ACP Sessions

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-04-03  

## Context

OpenCode follows the standard OpenAI chat completions pattern: every request
includes the **full conversation history** as a messages array. This is correct
for stateless APIs where the server has no memory — the client must replay
everything.

ACP sessions are stateful. The copilot-language-server accumulates context
across `session/prompt` calls within the same session. Each prompt adds a
turn to the session's internal history.

When the proxy forwarded the full message array (flattened to text) into a
reused ACP session, the model received every prior message twice: once from
the ACP session's accumulated state, and once from the replayed history in
the current prompt.

### Empirical evidence

**Duplication confirmed.** Turn 1: "My name is Alice." Turn 2: OpenCode
replayed [Alice message, assistant reply, new question]. The ACP session
already had the Alice exchange. Model responded: "you've told me your name
**twice**."

**The duplication compounded.** Each subsequent turn added another full copy of
all prior messages. By turn N, the model saw approximately N copies of the
early messages. This wasted context window, confused the model, and caused
stale context to dominate recent instructions.

**Stale context caused session poisoning.** When an error occurred mid-
conversation, the duplicated stale context dominated the model's attention.
The model acted on old context from prior turns rather than the current
instruction, creating a feedback loop where the session became unusable.

## Decision

The proxy extracts only the **last user message** from OpenCode's messages
array and sends it as the sole content in the `session/prompt` call. All
prior messages (system prompts, earlier user turns, assistant responses) are
discarded.

Two static helpers in `client.py`:
- `extract_last_user_message(messages)` — returns the content of the final
  user-role message (the new turn).
- `extract_first_user_message(messages)` — returns the content of the first
  user-role message (used as the conversation anchor for session identification;
  see ADR-002).

## Rationale

- **ACP sessions already have the history.** The session accumulates all prior
  turns. Replaying them is redundant and harmful.
- **Eliminates the duplication root cause.** Rather than trying to diff the
  replayed history against what the session has seen, which would be complex
  and fragile, we simply send only what's new.
- **OpenCode's system prompt is replaced.** OpenCode's ~15K char system prompt
  (describing its own tools) conflicts with the ACP server's tool definitions
  (see ADR-003, ADR-007). Stripping it and replacing with an injected system
  prompt resolves the two-agent-runtime collision.

## Consequences

- **OpenCode's system prompt is invisible to the model.** Any instructions
  OpenCode embeds in system messages (mode switches, tool descriptions, coding
  standards) are discarded. The injected system prompt (ADR-003) must cover
  all necessary guidance.
- **`<system-reminder>` tags are lost.** OpenCode communicates mode (build vs
  plan) and context updates via `<system-reminder>` tags embedded in message
  content. Since only the last user message is forwarded, these tags from
  earlier messages are stripped. Mode control must be handled through the
  system prompt.
- **Assistant turn context is implicit.** The model doesn't receive explicit
  assistant messages from OpenCode — it relies on its own ACP session memory.
  If the ACP session is lost or recreated, the model loses all prior context.
- **Robust against OpenCode changes.** The proxy doesn't depend on the
  structure or content of OpenCode's system prompt. Changes to OpenCode's
  prompt engineering don't affect the proxy.
