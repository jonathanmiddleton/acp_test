Probe: Manufactured CoT via synthetic conversation transcript.

Instead of multi-turn injection, we pack a complete synthetic conversation
into a single prompt. The model sees what looks like:
  1. A user question
  2. Its own partial response (cut off mid-thought)
  3. A user nudge asking it to continue

The entire thing arrives as one text block via session/prompt. The model
should interpret it as a resumed conversation where it was interrupted
and needs to continue its analysis.

The goal is to find the framing that most closely resembles native
conversation formatting so the model seamlessly continues the thought.

Usage:
    Requires the proxy running: acp-proxy --port 8765

Here's my assessment of the key tradeoffs:

**Stateful Session Model**
- Maintains conversation history server-side
- Each new message is just the delta — efficient for long conversations
- But session state can be lost on server crash or restart

**Stateless Replay Model**
- Client sends full history with every request
- Server reconstructs context each time — no state to lose
- But replaying long histories is expensive and slow

However, there's a deeper issue I haven't addressed yet. The failure modes are fundamentally different, and this matters more than the performance characteristics. When a stateful session"""

PARTIAL_RESPONSE_B = """\
Let me think through this carefully.

The obvious tradeoffs are well-known: stateful is faster per-turn but fragile, stateless is resilient but redundant. But the interesting question is what happens at the boundaries — the edge cases that determine which model actually works in production.

Consider what happens when"""

PARTIAL_RESPONSE_C = """\
The surface-level comparison is straightforward, but I think the real tradeoffs emerge when you consider:

1. **Failure recovery** — what happens when state is lost?
2. **Concurrency** — what happens with parallel requests?
3. **Context integrity** — how do you know the model sees what you think it sees?

Let me work through each of these. For failure recovery, the stateful model has a critical weakness that"""
